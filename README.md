# Q-Learning-Visual

A visualization for the naive Q-Learning approach for Artificial Intelligence.
The grid map works as a "X-ray" for the agent Q-values (State-Action pairs).

You can adjust the simulation speed on the greedy strategy by using the UP and DOWN keys on the keyboard,
also adjust the exploration rate by the + and - keys.

In the manual version, the agent movement can be controlled by the UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT keyboard keys.
